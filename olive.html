            <h2> My Intent</h2>
            <p> Olive is a health app centered around organizing personal health information, aiming to assist those interested in exercise and fitness, dietary health, and medication tracking. The app is designed for the general public who want to
              be mindful of personal health amidst busy daily life and could benefit from the provided structure. </p>

            <h4> Research goals: </h4>
            <ul>
              <li> how the average person views health apps </li>
              <li> tools that participants deem helpful and may use </li>
            </ul>
            <h4> What I hoped to learn: </h4>
            <p> From having open conversations with participants, I planned to learn more about health application perceptions, daily habits, and how my health app can be incorporated with these habits, and any other opinions or perspectives about
              health tools. </p>
            <!-- how to include quotes here as like a "visual", but it's still text -->
            <p> Based on interviews done, potential users are looking for convenient and accurate statistics trackers, variety in categories and topics to organize and learn about, and more detailed and customizable medication tools. </p>

            <p> Based on my user research, I created 2 personas to portray the target audience and help me keep aligned with their needs and goals as I design. </p>
            <div>

              <p> Joel has been wondering if how he gyms is the right way for his body type. He aims to learn more about different exercises and routines to figure out how to best benefit his health. And he would like to work on his physical health
                without external pressure! </p>
              <p> Let's take a look at what steps Joel may take in our app to reach one of his goals. Here is one task and user flow for Joel - Research and choose an exercise routine: </p>

              <p> Miya, with her multiple daily medications, would like to stay on top of each one. Sheâ€™d like to receive reminders on her phone for the times needed to take her medications. She's also concerned about the lack of information the
                average person has for taking medication. She's looking for more accessible resources and tools to keep people educated on how to safely manage health when medication is a factor. </p>

            </picture>
            <p> The combination of interviews and persona-building provided a clearer picture and helped me to create a sitemap, which became the blueprint for Olive and all its features. Planning out the potential journey and steps that users may
              take presented tasks and goals Olive can assist with. This helped form categories that developed into the pages seen in the above sitemap. </p>
            <h3> Card Sorting </h3>

            <p> Open card sorting results yielded patterns and helped me refine the structure of pages and content within Olive. Grouping content that was recognized together will help users make these connections, leading to smoother navigating and
              helping to complete tasks within Olive more easily. </p>

              <h2> Wireframing </h2>
              <p>
                Early in the design phase, I started working on 3 main challenges, reflected by the target audience:
              <ul>
                <li> health information offered as a learning resource </li>
                <li> health stats tracking </li>
                <li> being able to set reminders </li>
              </ul>
              Sketching on pen and paper to designing higher fidelity prototypes helped me stay focused on users' needs.

                <li> Determine if participants understand the search sectionâ€™s function/purpose (for finding health-related articles) </li>
                <li> Observe how participants interact with data tracking system and if reactions are in favor of said structure </li>
                <li> Receive feedback on accessibility options, if expansive enough or too expansive </li>

            </picture>
            <h4> Outcome </h4>
            <p> This usability test allowed me to observe how my participants interacted with my prototype to try to complete the tasks I gave. The focus was on the 3 challenges I was interested in learning more about, which were setting reminders,
              searching for information resources, and accessibility settings. Each one led to useful feedback on these specific features but also allowed me to gather feedback about the general functionality of the appâ€™s layout. </p>
            <p> To analyze the usability test results, I used affinity mapping and a rainbow spreadsheet to help me organize and prioritize the observed issues. Picking out and grouping significant feedback helped visualize problems and positives.
            </p>
            <p> I found that there were a few issues needed to be resolved: </p>
            <!--how do i bold this did i learn this yet lol-->
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li> unclear onboarding tutorial </li>
              <li> users were unsure of the purpose for certain features (e.g. Search section, app settings options, alarm icons) </li>
              <li> visibility problems like button sizes being too small </li>
            </ul>

            <p> Here, we see that I iterated with improving clarity and visibility in mind, along with implementation of the visual design. </p>
            <p> The Search section is more understandable now as the resource for users to browse and learn about different health topics. </p>
            <p> Buttons have been updated into different color shades and more substantial sizes to aid users. </p>

            <h2> Final Thoughts </h2>
            <p> As proud as I am with the design so far, I know that thereâ€™s always areas in which I can improve. What I noticed is that itâ€™s hard to balance customization and usability. Itâ€™s a challenge to draw focus on one without the sacrifice of
              the other. Iâ€™m excited to work on more projects and studies that will help me have a better understanding of how to balance the two and at times know when itâ€™s right to maybe even prioritize one over the other. With Olive, I had the
              opportunity to go through the whole process of a user experience design and receive feedback from peers, teachers, and everyday folks. Itâ€™s been eye-opening learning how to communicate and convey my ideas to different people, as Iâ€™m
              sure it will be important in my uxer journey and the rest of my career.
